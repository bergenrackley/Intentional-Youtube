# 🎯 Intentional YouTube

A Chrome extension that helps you use YouTube more intentionally by blocking algorithmic content during your focus hours.

## 🧠 Purpose

YouTube is great for learning and entertainment — but its homepage and endless recommendations can turn into a productivity trap. This extension redirects you away from mindless browsing and helps you stay focused.

## ✅ Features

- ⏰ **Custom Schedule**: Set blocking hours for each day of the week.
- 🚫 **Blocks Distractions**: Redirects you from the YouTube homepage and other non-intentional pages during blocked times.
- 🎯 **Allows Intentional Use**:
  - You can still access:
    - Your Subscriptions (`/feed/subscriptions`)
    - Individual videos (`/watch`)
    - Search results (`/results`)
    - Account/settings pages (`/account`)
- ⚙️ **Quick Access**: Configure schedule directly from the extension popup.
